# Digit Recognizer

## Objective
Implement a digit recognizer model using either Pytorch, Keras or Tensorflow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Description
The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Your task is to build a digit recognizer model that can accurately classify these digits.

## Requirements
1. **Data Loading:** Load the MNIST dataset using data loading utilities.
2. **Model Definition:** Create a neural network model for digit recognition. You can use a simple feedforward neural network.
3. **Training:** Train your model on the training set of the MNIST dataset. Use an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
4. **Validation:** Evaluate the performance of your model on a separate validation set. Report metrics such as accuracy.
5. **Testing:** Test your trained model on a test set that was not used during training or validation.
6. **Visualization:** Visualize a few input images along with their corresponding predicted and actual labels.

### Dataset can be found either in kaggle or in the libraries itself like pytorch.

**Note:** Feel free to explore additional features or techniques to enhance your digit recognizer model. Good luck!
